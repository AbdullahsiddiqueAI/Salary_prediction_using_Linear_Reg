# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
This project involves predicting salaries based on years of experience using a Linear Regression model. The dataset used is from Kaggle, which contains two columns: YearsExperience and Salary.

# Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link:
Salary Data CSV

# Data Processing
Loading the Data
The data is loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

# Exploring the Data
The first few rows of the DataFrame are printed to get an overview of the dataset.
The shape of the dataset is checked to understand the number of rows and columns.
Missing values are checked to ensure data quality.
Splitting the Data
The features (YearsExperience) and the target (Salary) are separated into different variables.

# Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

# Model Training
Training the Linear Regression Model
A custom Linear Regression model from the Lin_Reg_model module is used. The model is trained using the training data with a specified learning rate and number of iterations.

# Model Parameters
The trained model's parameters, weight and bias, are printed to understand the learned linear relationship between experience and salary.

# Prediction
Predicting the Salary for Test Data
The model is used to predict salaries for the test data.

# Visualization
Visualizing Predicted vs Actual Values
A scatter plot is created to visualize the predicted salaries against the actual salaries from the test set. A line plot is also included to show the regression line.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of training a Linear Regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model's performance can be evaluated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values visually and statistically.
